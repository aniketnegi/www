- reading the intro sections on the futo [self-hosted wiki](https://wiki.futo.org/index.php/Introduction_to_a_Self_Managed_Life:_a_13_hour_%26_28_minute_presentation_by_FUTO_software) has made me realise that open src software should not be complicated. because of the complications of (in many cases), setting up and solving issues on FOSS, people are pushed towards closed source. convenience matters to people who are not programmers. Convenience matters to users. More than I previously thought. or maybe I do not have an accurate image of an average user in my mind because I have lived too long among developers. I must leave my imaginary palace and travel among the masses to gain some perspective (said every westoid travelling to somewhere other than NA/Europe xd).
