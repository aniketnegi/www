#### TODO

- Meet with a friend. _(done)_ damn so tough to meet old friends. SO much to sort through... :/

### AM

- Decentralized systems not built on resource heavy blockchains (so that they can be run on the more popular form factor (mobile phones)). Discuss with Darsh. _(0720)_

### PM

- can't get back what you threw away mate
