### AM

- I have noticed - whenever I think that I am out of time or have the lack of time, for implementing an idea, or doing some work (in dev or art or anything productive), it is usually because I am comparing the current state of my work to the finished work I see around me and on social media. _(0745)_
  - This happens when I have a programming related idea, or something I could make in blender or writing.
  - Something else that happens because of this is I'm afraid to iterate. I refuse to believe that my idea (like the others I have seen online) is not perfect, failing to take into account the countless iterations that would have had before it was shared. This leads to my "final product" being inferior to what I had imagined it would look like, and that in turn discourages me to pursue such an endeavour again, classic vicious cycle.
  - Perhaps this is why I view my own work as sub-par.
  - Maybe I am doing the same thing with life as a whole and where I am currently.
  - It is also why my plans are so much grander, and imo, much more unachievable for me. Because I mistake myself for the people that I look up to, and then fail to deal with the inevitable failure that accompanies.
