All that is gold does not glitter,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all those who wander are lost;  
The old that is strong does not wither,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A light from the shadows shall spring;  
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The crownless again shall be king.
