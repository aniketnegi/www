If you can keep your head when all about you  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;But make allowance for their doubting too;  
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:  

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;  
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:  

If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never breathe a word about your loss;  
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’  

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;If all men count with you, but none too much;  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute  
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
