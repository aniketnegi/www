Out of the night that covers me,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Black as the pit from pole to pole,  
I thank whatever gods may be  
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my unconquerable soul.  

In the fell clutch of circumstance  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not winced nor cried aloud.  
Under the bludgeonings of chance  
&nbsp;&nbsp;My head is bloody, but unbowed.  

Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looms but the Horror of the shade,  
And yet the menace of the years  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds and shall find me unafraid.  

It matters not how strait the gate,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;How charged with punishments the scroll,  
I am the master of my fate,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the captain of my soul.
