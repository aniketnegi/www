Tyger Tyger, burning bright,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forests of the night;  
What immortal hand or eye,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could frame thy fearful symmetry?  

In what distant deeps or skies.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnt the fire of thine eyes?  
On what wings dare he aspire?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hand, dare seize the fire?  

And what shoulder, & what art,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could twist the sinews of thy heart?  
And when thy heart began to beat.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What dread hand? & what dread feet?  

What the hammer? what the chain,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In what furnace was thy brain?  
What the anvil? what dread grasp.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare its deadly terrors clasp?  

When the stars threw down their spears  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And water'd heaven with their tears:  
Did he smile his work to see?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he who made the Lamb make thee?  

Tyger Tyger burning bright,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forests of the night:  
What immortal hand or eye,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
