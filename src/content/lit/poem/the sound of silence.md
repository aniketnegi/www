As the leaves of the tree rustle  
&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear a symphony.  
A symphony of solace.  

As the waves of the ocean rise  
&nbsp;&nbsp;They whisper to you in silence.  
The sound of which was unheard amongst the clamours.  

As the city noises run towards you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;You begin to search for tranquility within yourself.  
You listen to your heartbeat,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, you find the repose you have always cast about.
